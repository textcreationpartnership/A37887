            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the King ſeduced by wicked Counſell hath raiſed an Army, and leavied Wane againſt the Parliament, and great number of Forces are daily raiſed under the commands of Papiſts and other ill-affected perſons, by Commiſſions from His Majeſtie; And whereas divers Delinquents are protected from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice by his Majeſties Army, and ſundry outrages and rapines are daily committed by the Souldiers of the ſaid Army, who have no reſpect to the Laws of God or the Land, but burn and plunder the Houſes, and ſeize and deſtroy the perſons and goods of divers His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties good ſubjects; And whereas for the maintenance of the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my divers aſſeſſements are made upon ſeverall Counties, and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſubiects are compelled by the Souldiers to pay the ſame; which ſaid Army if it ſhould continue, would ſoon ruine and waſte the whole kingdome, and overthrow Religion, Law, and Libertie. For ſuppreſſing of which ſaid Army and ill affected perſons, there is no probable way under God, but by the Army raiſed by Authority of the Parliament; which ſaid Army ſo raiſed, cannot be maintained without great ſummes of money, yet for raiſing ſuch ſummes, by reaſon of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties withdrawing himſelf from the advice of the Parliament, there can be no Act of Parliament paſſed with his Majeſties aſſent, albeit there is great Juſtice that the ſaid moneys ſhould be raiſed: The Lords and Commons in Parliament, having taken the ſame into their ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and knowing that the ſaid Army ſo raiſed by them, hath been hitherto for the moſt part maintained by the voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divers well-affected perſons, who have freely contributed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities.</p>

            <p>Be it therefore Ordained by the Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſembled, and by authority thereof, that <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi> Lord Major

            <p>And in caſe the owner of ſuch proviſions, money, plate, and Horſes, ſhall refuſe or neglect to bring in the ſame upon the publick faith for the uſe of the Army, for the better preventing the ſpoyle and embeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſuch proviſions of money, plate, and Horſes, by the diſorder of the Souldiers, and that they may not come inno the hands of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it is further ordered, that the Committees afore mentioned, or any tvvo of them, be hereby authorized and enabled to ſend for ſuch proviſions, money, plate, and Horſes, and take the ſame into their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and to ſet an indifferent value and rate upon them; vvhich value they ſhall certifie to the Treaſurers for the propoſitions, to be repayed at ſuch time, and in ſuch manner, as ſhall be Ordered by both Houſes of Parliament. It is likevviſe Ordered, that the ſaid Committees of the ſeverall and reſpective Counties ſhall meet and conſult vvith the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of the adjacent and neighbour Counties, unto the place or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vvhere the ſaid Army, or any part thereof, ſhall paſſe and remain, concerning the receiving, procuring, valuing and diſpoſing of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, horſes, money, and plate.

And the ſaid Committees, or any tvvo or more of them, ſhall cauſe the ſaid proviſions to be delivered to the commiſſary for the Victualls, or to his Deputy, and ſuch other Officers of the Army, vvho may be charged vvith the ſame upon their accompt, and ſhall certifie the Treaſurer of the Army, or his Deputy, that ſo defalcation of the value thereof may be made out of the pay of ſuch Officers and Souldiers as ſhall receive the ſame. And the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſhall likevviſe cauſe all ſuch money and plate to be delivered unto the Treaſurer of the Army, or his Deputy, vvho ſhall take care to convey the Plate unto the Treaſurer for the propoſitions, and ſhall be charged vvith all ſuch money upon his accompt as vvith other money recieved from them.</p>

            <head>His MAJESTIES Declaration to all His lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects upon occaſion of the aforeſaid Ordinance and Declaration.</head>
            <p>IT would not be believed (at leaſt great pains have been taken that it might not) that the pretended Ordinance of the Militia (the firſt attempt that ever was to make a Law by Ordinance without Our conſent) or the keeping Us out Hull, and taking Our Arms and Munition from Us, could any way concern the Intereſt, Property, or Liberty of the Subject, and it was confeſſed by that deſperate Declaration it ſelf of the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> that if they were found guilty of that charge of deſtroying the Title and Intereſt of Our Subjects to their Lands and Goods, it were indeed a very great crime. But it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46720:5"/>was a ſtrange fatall Lethargy which had ſeſſed Our good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and kept them from diſcerning, that the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Commonalty of <hi>England,</hi> were not onely ſtripped of their preheminences and Priviledges, but of their Liberties and Eſtates, when Our juſt Rights were denied Us, and that no Subject could from thenceforth expect to dwell at home, when We were driven from Our Houſes and Our Towns. It was not poſſible, that a Commiſſion could be granted to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to raiſe an Army againſt Us, and for the ſafety of Our perſon, and preſervation of the peace of the Kingdome, to purſue, kill &amp; ſlay Vs, and all who wiſh well to Us, but that in a ſhort time inferiour Commanders, by the ſame Authority, would require Our good Subjects for the maintenance of the property of the Subject, to ſupply them with ſuch ſummes of money as they think ſit, upon the penalty of being plundered with all extremity of Warre (as the ſtile of Sir <hi>Edward Bayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> warrant runs againſt Our poore Subjects in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>) and by ſuch rules of unlimited Arbitrary power, as are inconſiſtent with the leaſt pretence or ſhadow of that Property it would ſeem to defend.</p>
            <p>If there could be yet any underſtanding ſo unskilfull and ſupine to believe, That theſe Diſturbers of the publick peace do intend any thing but a generall confuſion, they have brought them a ſad Argument to their own doores to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them; after this Ordinance and Declaration, 'tis not in any ſober mans power to believe himſelf worth any thing, or that there is ſuch a thing as Law, Liberty, Property left in England, under the juriſdiction of theſe men, and the ſame power that robs them now of the Twentieth part of their eſtates, hath by that but made a claime and entitled it ſelf to the other Ninteen, when it ſhall be thought fit to haſten the generall ruine. Sure, if the minds of all men be not ſtubbornly prepared for ſervitude, they will looke on this Ordinance as the greateſt Prodigy of Arbitrary power and tyranny, that any Age hath brought forth in any kingdome, other grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (and the greateſt) have been conceived intolerable, rather
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46720:6"/>by the Logick and Conſequence, they by the Preſſure it ſelf, this at once ſweeps away all, that the wiſdome and juſtice of Parliaments have provided for them. Is their property in their eſtates (ſo carefully looked to by their Anceſtours, and ſo amply eſtabliſhed by Vs againſt any poſſibility of Invaſion from the Crown) which makes the meaneſt Subject as much a Lord of his own, as the greateſt Peere, to be valued or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? here is a twentieth part of every mans eſtate (or ſo much more as foure men will pleaſe to call the Twentieth part) taken away at once, and yet a power left to take a twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth ſtill of that which remaines, and this to be leavied by ſuch circumſtances of ſeverity, as no Act of Parliament ever conſented to. Is their liberty which diſtinguiſhes Subjects from ſlaves, and in which this free-borne Nation hath the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all Chriſtendome, deare to them? they ſhall not onely be impriſon'd in ſuch places of this kingdome, (a latitude of judgement no Court can challenge to it ſelf in any Caſes) but for ſo long time as the Committee of the Houſe of Commons for examination ſhall appoint and order; the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons it ſelf having never aſſumed, or in the leaſt degree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a power of judicature, having no more Authority to adminiſter an oath (the onely way to diſcover and find out the truth of facts) to, then to cut off the heads of any of Our Subjects; and this Committee being ſo farre from being a part of the Parliament, that it is deſtructive to the whole, by uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to it ſelf all the power of King, Lords, and Commons. All who know any thing of Parliaments know that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of either Houſe ought not by the Law to publiſh their own Reſultes, neither are their concluſions of any force with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Confirmation of the Houſe, which hath the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of controling them, as if the matter had never been deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but that any Committee ſhould be ſo contracted (as this of Examination, a ſtyle no Committee ever bore before this Parliament) as to exclude the Members of the Houſe, who are equally truſted by their Country, from being preſent at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46720:6"/>the Counſells, is ſo monſtrous to the priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is no more in the power of any man to give up that freedome, then of himſelf to order, that from that time the place for which he ſerves, ſhall never more ſend a Knight or Burgeſſe to the Parliament, and in truth is no leſſe then to alter the whole frame of government, to pull up Parliaments by the rootes, and to commit the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of all the people of England, to the Arbitrary power of a few unqualified perſons, who ſhall diſpoſe thereof according to their diſcretion, without account to any rule or Authority whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Are their friends, their Wives, and Children (the greateſt bleſſings of peace, and the comforts of Life) pretious to them? would even their penury and impriſonment be leſſe grievous by thoſe cordials? they ſhall be divorced from them, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhall no longer remaine within the Cities of London and Weſtminſter, the Suburbes and the Counties adjacent; and how farre thoſe adjacent Counties ſhall extend no man knowes.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing now left to enjoy, but the Liberty to rebell, and deſtroy one another? are the outward bleſſings onely of peace, property, and liberty, taken, and forced from Our Subjects? are their Conſciences free and unaſſaulted by the violence of theſe fire-brands? Sure the liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Conſcience cannot ſuffer by theſe men: Alas! all theſe puniſhments are impoſed upon them becauſe they will not ſubmit to Actions contrary to their naturall loyalty, to their Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and to their late voluntary Proteſtation, which obliges them to the care of Our perſon and Our juſt Rights.</p>
            <p>How many perſons of Honour, Quality, and Reputation of the ſeverall Counties of England, are now impriſoned, without any objection againſt them, but ſuſpition of their loyalty? How many of the graveſt and moſt ſuſtantiall Citizens of London, by whom the government and diſcipline of that City was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, are diſgraced, robbed, and impriſoned, without any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46720:7"/>proceſſe of Law, or colour of accuſation, but of obedience to the Law and Government of the Kingdome? whil'ſt Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and Browniſts with the aſſiſtance of vitious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſhed perſons, of deſperate Fortunes take upon them to break up and rifle houſes, as publike and avowed Miniſters of a new invented Authority; How many godly, pious, and painfull Divines, whoſe lives and learning hath made them of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend eſtimation, are now ſlandered with inclination to popery, diſcountenanced, and impriſoned, for diſcharging their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in inſtructing the people in the Chriſtian duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Obedience, whilſt Schiſmaticall, illiterate, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous preachers, fill the Pulpits and Churches with blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, irreverence, and treaſon, and incite their Auditory to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but murther and rebellion; We paſſe over the vulgar charm, by which they have captivated ſuch who have been contented to diſpence with their Conſciences for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their eſtates, and by which they perſwade men chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to part with this twentieth part of their eſtate to the good work in hand, for whoever will give what he hath may eſcape robbing; <hi>They ſhall be repaid upon the publick faith as all other monies lent upon the Propoſitions of both Houſes;</hi> It may be ſo, but men muſt be condemned to a ſtrange unthriftineſſe who will lend upon ſuch ſecuritie.</p>
            <p>The publick Faith indeed is as great an earneſt as the State can give, and engages the Honour, Reputation and Honeſty, of the Nation, and is the Act of the Kingdome, it is the ſecurity of the King, the Lords and Commons, which can never need an Executour, can never die, never be Bankrupt, and therefore We willingly conſented to it for indemnitie of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (who we hope will not think the worſe of it, for being ſo often and ſo cheaply mentioned ſince.) But that a Vote of one or both Houſes ſhould be an engagement upon the publick faith, is as impoſſible, as that the Committee of the Houſe of Commons for Examinations, ſhould be the High Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And what is or can be ſaid with the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46720:7"/>to juſtifie theſe extravagances? We have not lately heard of the old fundamentall Laws which uſed to warrant the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, this needs a Refuge even below thoſe foundations: They will ſay they cannot manage their great undertakings without ſuch extraordinarie wayes; We think ſo too, but that proves onely they have undertaken ſomewhat they ought not to undertake, not that it is lawfull for them to do any thing that is convenient for thoſe ends. We remembred them long ago, and We cannot do it too often, of that excellent Speech of M. <hi>Pyms. The Law is that which puts a difference betwixt good and evil, betwixt juſt and unjuſt, if you take away the Law, all things will fall into a confuſion, every man will become a Law unto himſelf, which in the depraved condition of humane nature, muſt needs produce many great enormities, Luſt will become a Law, and Envy will become a Law, Coveteouſneſſe and Ambition will become Lawes, and what Dictates, what Deciſions ſuch Lawes will produce may eaſily be diſcerned.</hi> It may indeed by the ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances over the whole Kingdome; But will Poſteritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that in the ſame Parliament this doctrine was avowed with that Acclamation, and theſe inſtances after produced; That in the ſame Parliament ſuch care was taken that no man ſhould be committed in what caſe ſoever, without the cauſe of his Impriſonment expreſſed, and that all men ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately bayled in all Caſes baylable, and during the ſame Parliament that Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> or indeed any body elſe, but the ſworn Miniſters of Juſtice, ſhould impriſon whom they would, and for what they would, and for as long time as they would; That the King ſhould he reproached with breach of Priviledge for accuſing Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> of high treaſon, when with force of Arms he kept him out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to his face, becauſe in no caſe a Member of either Houſe might be committed or accuſed without leave of that Houſe, of which he is a Member, and yet that during the ſame Parliament, the ſame Alderman ſhould commit the Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi> (a Peer of the Realm) and the Lord <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> (a Member of the Houſe of Commons) to the <hi>Counter</hi> without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46720:8"/>reprehenſion; That to be a Traitour (which is defined &amp; every man underſtands) ſhould be no crime, and to be called a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant (which no body knows the meaning of) ſhould be ground enough for cloſe impriſonment; That a Law ſhould be made, that whoſoever ſhould preſume to take tunnage and poundage without an Act of Parliament, ſhould incurre the penaltie of a Premunire, and the ſame Parliament, that the ſame impoſition ſhould be laid upon Our Subjects, and taken by an Order of both Houſes, without and againſt Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Laſtly, that the ſame Parliament, a Law ſhould be made to declare the proceedings and judgement upon ſhip-money to be illegall and void, and during that Parliament, that an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of both Houſes ſhall, upon pretence of neceſſitie, inable foure men to take away the twentieth part of their eſtates from all their Neighbours, according to their diſcretion.</p>
            <p>But Our good Subjects will no longer look upon theſe and the like reſults, as upon the Counſels and concluſions of both Our Houſes of Parliament; (though all the world knows even that Authority can never juſtifie things unwarrantable by the Law) they well know how few of the Perſons truſted by them are preſent at their conſultations, of above 500 not 80. and of the Houſe of Peers, not a fifth part, that they who are preſent enjoy not the Priviledge and Freedome of Parliament, but are beſieged by an Army, and awed by the ſame tumults, which drave Vs and their fellow-Members from thence, to conſent to what ſome few Seditious, Schiſmaticall Perſons amongſt them do propoſe; Theſe are the men, who joyning with the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Browniſts</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> firſt changed the Government and Diſcipline of that City, and now by the pride and power of that City would undoe the Kingdome, whilſt their Lord Major (a Perſon accuſed and known to be guilty of high Treaſon) by a new Legiſlative power of his own, ſuppreſſes and reviles the book of Common-prayer, robbes and impriſons whom he thinks fit, and with the rabble of his Faction gives Laws to both Houſes of Parliament, and tells them they will have no Accommodation, whilſt the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46720:8"/>Members ſent and entruſted by their Countreys are expelled the Houſe, or committed for refuſing to take the Oath of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, to live and die with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as very lately Sir <hi>Sidny Mountague.</hi> Theſe are the men who have preſumed to ſend Ambaſſadours, and to enter into treaties with forrain States in their own behalfs, having at this time an Agent of their own with the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> to negotiate for them upon private inſtructions. Theſe are the men, who not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have yet brought miſchief enough upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at this time invite and ſollicite Our Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> to enter this land with an Army againſt Vs. In a word, theſe are the men who have made this laſt devouring Ordinance, to take away all Law, Libertie, and Property from Our people, and have by it really acted that upon Our people, which with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite malice, and no colour or ground, was laboured to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into them to have been Our intention by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Array.</p>
            <p>We have done; what power and Authority theſe men have, or will have, we know not, for Our ſelf we challenge none ſuch; We look upon the preſſures and inconveniences Our good Subjects beare, even by Vs and Our Army, (which the Army firſt raiſed by them enforced Vs to leavy in Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and their refuſall of all offers and deſires of Treaty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth Vs to keep) with very much ſadneſſe of heart; We are ſo far from requiring a twentieth part of their eſtates (though for their own viſible preſervation) that as We have already ſold or pawned Our own Jewels, &amp; coyned Our own Plate, ſo We are willing to ſell all Our own Land, and Houſes for their relief; yet We do not doubt but Our good Subjects will ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider Our condition and their own duties, and think Our readineſſe to protect them with the utmoſt hazard of Our life, deſerves their readines to aſſiſt Vs with ſome part of their fortunes, &amp; whilſt other men give a 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of their eſtates, to enable them to forfeit the other nineteen that they wil extend themſelves to Us in a liberal &amp; free propoſition for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the reſt, &amp; for the maintenance of Gods true religion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46720:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Laws of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and very being of Parliaments, and this Kingdome; for if all theſe ever were, or can be in manifeſt danger, it is now in this preſent Rebellion againſt Vs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We will and require all Our loving Subjects of what degree or quality ſoever, as they will anſwer it to God, to Vs, and to poſterity, by their oathes of Allegeance and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as they would not be looked upon now, and remembred hereafter as betrayers of the Laws and Liberty they were born to, that they in no degree ſubmit to this wilde pretended Ordinance, and that they preſume not to give any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or aſſiſtance to the Army now in Rebellion againſt Vs, which if notwithſtanding they ſhall do, they muſt expect from Vs the ſevereſt puniſhment the Law can inflict, and a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Infamy with all good men.</p>
